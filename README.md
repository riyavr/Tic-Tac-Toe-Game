# Tic-Tac-Toe-Game
Tic-tac-toe, noughts and crosses, or Xs and Os is a paper-and-pencil game for two players, X and O, who take turns marking the spaces in a 3Ã—3 grid.
The player who succeeds in placing three of their marks in a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal row is the winner.
Players soon discover that the best play from both parties leads to a draw.
